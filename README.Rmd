The goal of evolveTrial is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of evolveTrial from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("naimurashid/evolveTrial")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(evolveTrial)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

## Diagnosing interim gating choices

When early stopping does not seem to occur during simulations, it is
often because the information gates (minimum events, median follow-up,
or required person-time) postpone the first informative interim look
until late in the trial.  The helper `estimate_vsref_gate_timing()` gives
quick lower-bound heuristics for when those gates can all be satisfied
under deterministic accrual.

``` r
library(evolveTrial)

args <- list(
  arm_names = c("Doublet", "Triplet"),
  reference_arm_name = "Doublet",
  overall_accrual_rate = 3,
  randomization_probs = c(Doublet = 0.5, Triplet = 0.5),
  max_total_patients_per_arm = c(Doublet = 70, Triplet = 70),
  max_follow_up_sim = 24,
  min_events_per_arm = 8,
  min_median_followup_per_arm = 3,
  min_person_time_frac_per_arm = 0.15
)

estimate_vsref_gate_timing(args)
```

For the configuration above the joint lower bound is roughly
18 months, meaning that with 3-month calendar beats the first eligible
interim look will occur near the sixth look.  Adjusting the information
gates (for example by lowering the person-time fraction or the minimum
median follow-up) yields earlier opportunities for efficacy/futility
stopping.

**evolveTrial** provides utilities for designing and simulating Bayesian adaptive platform and umbrella clinical trials. The package includes tools for:

- Simulating multi-arm adaptive trials with time-to-event endpoints
- Bayesian decision rules for efficacy and futility stopping
- Piecewise exponential hazard models with proportional hazards
- Interim analysis timing and information gates
- Operating characteristic summaries and diagnostics

## Installation

### From GitHub (Recommended)

Install the development version from GitHub using one of these methods:

```r
# Using pak (fastest)
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("naimurashid/evolveTrial")

# Or using remotes
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("naimurashid/evolveTrial")

# Or using devtools
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("naimurashid/evolveTrial")
```

### Dependencies

The package requires:

- **Core**: `data.table`, `ggplot2`, `magrittr`, `progress`, `tidyselect`
- **Suggested**: `dplyr`, `gt`, `openxlsx`, `ggrepel`, `knitr`, `rmarkdown`

All dependencies will be installed automatically when you install evolveTrial.

### Development Installation

For development work with the latest features:

```r
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/naimurashid/evolveTrial.git

# Load in R session
devtools::load_all("path/to/evolveTrial")
```

## Diagnosing interim gating choices

When early stopping does not seem to occur during simulations, it is
often because the information gates (minimum events, median follow-up,
or required person-time) postpone the first informative interim look
until late in the trial.  The helper `estimate_vsref_gate_timing()` gives
quick lower-bound heuristics for when those gates can all be satisfied
under deterministic accrual.

``` r
library(evolveTrial)

args <- list(
  arm_names = c("Doublet", "Triplet"),
  reference_arm_name = "Doublet",
  overall_accrual_rate = 3,
  randomization_probs = c(Doublet = 0.5, Triplet = 0.5),
  max_total_patients_per_arm = c(Doublet = 70, Triplet = 70),
  max_follow_up_sim = 24,
  min_events_per_arm = 8,
  min_median_followup_per_arm = 3,
  min_person_time_frac_per_arm = 0.15
)

estimate_vsref_gate_timing(args)
```

For the configuration above the joint lower bound is roughly
18 months, meaning that with 3-month calendar beats the first eligible
interim look will occur near the sixth look.  Adjusting the information
gates (for example by lowering the person-time fraction or the minimum
median follow-up) yields earlier opportunities for efficacy/futility
stopping.

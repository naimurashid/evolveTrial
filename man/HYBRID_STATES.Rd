HYBRID_STATES
}
\description{
This module provides the main simulation engine for hybrid trials that:
\enumerate{
\item Begin with single-arm monitoring vs historical control
\item Evaluate conversion to between-arm comparison based on predictive probability
\item Continue with between-arm monitoring using seamless data
Trial states for hybrid design

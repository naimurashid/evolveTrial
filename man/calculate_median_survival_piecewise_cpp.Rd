\title{Calculate median survival for piecewise exponential model (C++ implementation)}
\usage{
calculate_median_survival_piecewise_cpp(hazard_rates, interval_lengths)
}
\arguments{
\item{hazard_rates}{Numeric vector of hazard rates for each interval}

\item{interval_lengths}{Numeric vector of interval lengths (durations)}
}
\value{
Median survival time (numeric scalar, possibly Inf)
}
\description{
Computes the median survival time for a piecewise exponential model.
If the 0.5 survival is not reached by the end of the last interval,
continues past the last cutpoint with the last interval's hazard (open-ended tail).
Only returns Inf if the last hazard is exactly zero.

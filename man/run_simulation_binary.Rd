\arguments{
\item{num_simulations}{Number of Monte Carlo replicates}

\item{arm_names}{Character vector of arm names (typically single arm)}

\item{true_response_prob}{Named numeric vector of true response probabilities}

\item{n1_per_arm}{Named integer vector of stage 1 sample sizes}

\item{n_total_per_arm}{Named integer vector of total sample sizes}

\item{p0}{Null hypothesis response rate}

\item{p1}{Alternative hypothesis response rate}

\item{efficacy_threshold_binary_prob}{Posterior probability threshold for efficacy}

\item{futility_threshold_binary_prob}{Posterior probability threshold for futility}

\item{r1_per_arm}{Optional: Simon-style stage 1 boundaries (stop if X1 <= r1)}

\item{r_per_arm}{Optional: Simon-style total boundaries (success if X > r)}

\item{use_simon_rules}{Use exact Simon counting rules instead of Bayesian}

\item{alpha_prior}{Beta prior shape1 (default 1)}

\item{beta_prior}{Beta prior shape2 (default 1)}

\item{disable_interim_eff_stop}{If TRUE, do not stop for efficacy at interim
(only futility stopping at interim, efficacy only at final). This makes
the Bayesian design comparable to Simon's two-stage design which only
stops for futility at the interim.}

\item{diagnostics}{Print diagnostic messages}

\item{progress}{Show progress bar (default TRUE in interactive sessions)}
}
\value{
Data frame with operating characteristics per arm

\description{
Simulates a two-stage binary endpoint trial with Bayesian decision rules.
Supports Simon-style designs with cohort-based enrollment.

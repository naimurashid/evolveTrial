# evolveTrial

**evolveTrial** provides utilities for designing and simulating Bayesian
adaptive platform and umbrella clinical trials. The package includes
tools for:

- Simulating multi-arm adaptive trials with time-to-event endpoints
- Bayesian decision rules for efficacy and futility stopping
- Piecewise exponential hazard models with proportional hazards
- Interim analysis timing and information gates
- Operating characteristic summaries and diagnostics

## Installation

### From GitHub (Recommended)

Install the development version from GitHub using one of these methods:

``` r
# Using pak (fastest)
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("naimurashid/evolveTrial")

# Or using remotes
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("naimurashid/evolveTrial")

# Or using devtools
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("naimurashid/evolveTrial")
```

### Dependencies

The package requires:

- **Core**: `data.table`, `ggplot2`, `magrittr`, `progress`,
  `tidyselect`

All dependencies will be installed automatically when you install
evolveTrial.

### Development Installation

For development work with the latest features:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/naimurashid/evolveTrial.git

# Load in R session
devtools::load_all("path/to/evolveTrial")
```

## Diagnosing interim gating choices

When early stopping does not seem to occur during simulations, it is
often because the information gates (minimum events, median follow-up,
or required person-time) postpone the first informative interim look
until late in the trial. The helper
[`estimate_vsref_gate_timing()`](reference/estimate_vsref_gate_timing.md)
gives quick lower-bound heuristics for when those gates can all be
satisfied under deterministic accrual.

``` r
library(evolveTrial)

args <- list(
  arm_names = c("Doublet", "Triplet"),
  reference_arm_name = "Doublet",
  overall_accrual_rate = 3,
  randomization_probs = c(Doublet = 0.5, Triplet = 0.5),
  max_total_patients_per_arm = c(Doublet = 70, Triplet = 70),
  max_follow_up_sim = 24,
  min_events_per_arm = 8,
  min_median_followup_per_arm = 3,
  min_person_time_frac_per_arm = 0.15
)

estimate_vsref_gate_timing(args)
```

For the configuration above the joint lower bound is roughly 18 months,
meaning that with 3-month calendar beats the first eligible interim look
will occur near the sixth look. Adjusting the information gates (for
example by lowering the person-time fraction or the minimum median
follow-up) yields earlier opportunities for efficacy/futility stopping.

## All functions

- [`calculate_interval_metrics_fast()`](calculate_interval_metrics_fast.md)
  : Recalculates events and person-time using a more efficient
  data.table approach.

- [`calculate_median_survival_piecewise()`](calculate_median_survival_piecewise.md)
  :

  Computes the median survival time for a piecewise exponential model.
  If the 0.5 survival is not reached by the end of the last interval, we
  *continue past the last cutpoint* with the last interval's hazard
  (open-ended tail). Only return Inf if the last hazard is exactly zero.

- [`draw_posterior_hazard_samples()`](draw_posterior_hazard_samples.md)
  : Draws samples from the posterior distribution of hazard rates for
  each interval in a Bayesian piecewise exponential model with Gamma
  priors.

- [`estimate_vsref_gate_timing()`](estimate_vsref_gate_timing.md) :
  Estimate when the vs-reference interim gates can be satisfied
